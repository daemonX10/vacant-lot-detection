## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vacant-lot-detection.git
   cd vacant-lot-detection
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare your data:
   - Place your raw data files in the `data/raw` directory.
   - Process the data using the scripts in the `src` directory.

## Usage Examples
- To preprocess the data, run:
  ```
  python src/data_preprocessing.py
  ```

- To train the model, execute:
  ```
  python src/model_training.py
  ```

- To evaluate the model, use:
  ```
  python src/model_evaluation.py
  ```
